# Introduction 
A short paragraph introducing your project to the audience and a motivation for why this project is important. Itâ€™s fine to say your group has an interest in this topic and were keen to explore it more.
Through this project, we hope to raise awareness and promote a healthy lifestyle by showcasing the underlying factors of high healthcare charges in the US. We are living in a generation where technology is advancing rapidly which may lead to an unhealthy lifestyle due to many causes such as office syndrome. We feel like this topic should be explored in order to raise the awareness of society on the effects of unhealthy lifestyle. To support our goal, we will investigate the relationship between lifestyle variables such as age, BMI, and smoking habit with healthcare cost. As most of our variables are quantitative, different types of graphs such as scatter plots, bar graphs, and pie charts can be made. This means that building a user-facing dashboard is very viable using the datasets and research questions that we have. An example of this implementation would be to visualize how an increase in a variable (i.e. BMI) affect healthcare costs using a dynamic scatter plot. We believe that these and other supporting visualizations and information will be very beneficial for the audience to understand the impact of unhealthy lifestyle towards their medical bill.

# Exploratory Data Analysis 
A summary of the highlights of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.

# Question 1 + Results 
Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.

# Question 2 + Results 
Same as above.

# Question 3 + Results 
Same as above.

# Summary/Conclusion 
A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project.
