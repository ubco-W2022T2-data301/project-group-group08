## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our main dataset (Medical Cost Personal Datasets) were taken from Kaggle where the provider took it from a github user containing all datasets included in the Machine Learning with R book by Brett Lantz. The dataset contains 7 columns - age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region and charges. The purpose of this dataset is to is for users (or people who are studying the book) to be able to test their knowledge of machine learning and use the dataset to predict or answer different research questions. For the supporting dataset, the data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker as shown on Kaggle.
