## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We are using the medical expense dataset from the course page which provides details on the individual medical costs charged by health insurance in the US. Since the primary dataset doesnâ€™t provide the income of the individuals, we decided to find another dataset that provides the income of individuals in the US which we may use to merge with our primary dataset based on age.
