    "**What are the average healthcare costs and income for different age groups?**\n",
    "For this question, I plan to calculate the average healthcare cost and income for each age group and produce a graph where the x-axis is the age group and the y-axis is the amount. The graph will be plotted as a bar chart with 2 bars for each age group side by side, 1 for healthcare cost and the other for income.\n",

    "**Does the age group correlate with healthcare costs in a set of data collected from several regions in the US?**\n",
    "I plan to create a scatter plot for this question and see whether the data will create a correlated outcome that will be clear enough to create a line/curve of best fit or not. If the plot produced shows a weak correlation, I could add error bars and find the outlier for the dataset and drop those outliers. Thus, refining the dataset further and creating a stronger dataset.\n"
